Climate
================
A follow up project to our 2014 Koding Hackathon project, which you can see [here](https://github.com/cakesofwrath/ClimateChange.js).

Our hackathon project kind of sucked, and tried to shove some data at a globe library.

This is an attempt at building a similar project, from scratch, with vanilla d3, that will run faster.
